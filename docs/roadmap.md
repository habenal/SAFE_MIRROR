# Project Roadmap

Current Version: **v1.0 (MVP)**

## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed) 
- [x] **Core Analysis Engine**: Python-based Deepfake detection stub.
- [x] **Secure Backend**: Node.js/Express with AES-256 encryption.
- [x] **Survivor-Centered UI**: React frontend with Consent, Safe View, and Evidence Locker.
- [x] **Infrastructure**: Docker containerization for full stack.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Detection (Next Steps) 
- [ ] **Real AI Models**: Replace the 'stub' logic with PyTorch/TensorFlow models (e.g., XceptionNet, EfficientNet) for varying deepfake types.
- [ ] **Video Support**: Add `ffmpeg` pipeline to process video files frame-by-frame.
- [ ] **Audio Analysis**: Detect synthetic voices.

## Phase 3: Cloud & Scale 
- [ ] **Cloud Storage**: Integrate AWS S3 with Client-Side Encryption (CSE).
- [ ] **Auth System**: Implement full user authentication (OAuth2 / Passwordless) for multi-user support.
- [ ] **Mobile App**: React Native port for on-the-go analysis.

## Phase 4: Community & Legal 
- [ ] **Legal Export**: Generate reports formatted specifically for varying legal jurisdictions (e.g., chain of custody logs).
- [ ] **Support Integration**: Direct in-app links to local NGO support hotlines based on user location.
